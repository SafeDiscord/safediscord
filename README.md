### Todo

- [ ] re-think bot
- [ ] re-think data storage
- [ ] instructions on how to get a user's UUID for manually checking
- [ ] possible frontend search by UUID for offenders (haveibeenpwned.com-esque)
- [ ] possible online report via discordAuth login
- [ ] in-server reporting through the bot, based on roles/perms
- [ ] multiple ways to warn a server of possible troublemaker joining: PMs to certain ranks, specific channel, custom message
- [ ] learn how bots store configs per server
- [ ] learn how to do weighted search shenanigans for "this is the most common offense"
